FIRST FREEZE

This is the first frozen implementation of the electronics simulation
intended as a base for the mini-CAPTAIN cosmic ray production, and for the
mini-captain neutron response simulations.

BUG FIXES:

NEW FEATURES:

** Use output of NEST from DETSIM 0.0.1 or later to determine the number of
   electrons and photons to simulate

** Partial tuning based on pulser running.  This includes tuning the noise,
   and improving the simulated ASIC shaping.

** Parameterize a few hard coded values (e.g. the oversampling)

** Save true amount of charge deposited on a wire using TMCDigit info.

** Improve the model of the induced charge on wire.  This uses
   Shockley-Ramo to estimate the shape of the induced current by
   approximating the electron path and the weighting field.  The electrons
   are assumed to drift with constant velocity and in a straight line at a
   particular impact parameter relative to the wire.  The weighting field
   is assumed to be the same as a single wire, but with the condition that
   the field is zero at the grid planes.  The model incorrectly estimates
   the magnitude of the induced current, but is useful for estimating the
   time evolution of the current.  The magnitude of the current is
   estimated separately and is based on the distance of closest approach.

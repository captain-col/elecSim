This is the file of parameters to control the electronics simulation.

The amount of time to simulate before the trigger.

< elecSim.simple.preTriggerTime = 200 us >
< elecSim.simple.postTriggerTime = 800 us >

The integration window for the trigger.
< elecSim.simple.trigger.window = 500 ns > 

The time between triggers.  Part of this is dead time, part of it is the
integration.  
< elecSim.simple.trigger.integrationTime = 3 ms >

The offset between the trigger condition being met and the trigger.
< elecSim.simple.trigger.offset = 0 ns >

The trigger threshold in MeV.
< elecSim.simple.trigger.threshold = 5 MeV >

The probability that the electron will recombine with the argon ion.
< elecSim.simple.recombinationProb = 0.4291 >

The activation (ionization) energy for argon
< elecSim.simple.activationEnergy = 19.5 eV >

The Liquid Argon drift velocity to use. 
< elecSim.simple.drift.velocity = 1.6 mm/us >

The Liquid Argon diffusion coefficient to use.  This is from Shibamura et
al, "Ratio of Diffusion coefficient to electron mobility", PR A20, 1979
< elecSim.simple.drift.diffusion = 15 cm2/s >

The electron lifetime.
< elecSim.simple.drift.life = 2 ms >

The electronics noise quoted in effective electrons per second.  According
to talk at the Sante Fe collaboration meeting on 1 Feb 2013, the effective
noise rate is 600 electrons per 1 us, (600 MHz).  This is the noise that
comes before the amplifier shaping.  
< elecSim.simple.wire.noise = 600 MHz >

The amplifier shape peaking time.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.riseTime = 1000 ns >

The amplifier gain for the collection wires.  The gain must be matched to
the range of the ADC.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.gain.collection = 0.10 >

The amplifier gain for the induction wires.  The gain must be matched to
the range of the ADC.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.gain.induction = 0.10 >

The amplifier gain for the ganged PMTs.  The gain must be matched to
the range of the ADC.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.gain.pmt = 0.0005 >

The digitization "frequency" (actually the time per bin).  This should be
about 1/4 of the shape peaking time.  The electronics specs have not been
set yet.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.step = 500 ns >

The digitization noise that is not affected by the amplifier shaping.  This
noise is given in ADC counts.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.noise = 2.0 >

The digitization threshold.  A signal level over this triggers saving a
digit.   This is the difference between the current signal and the averaged
over the previous measurements.  This is given in ADC counts, but can be a
floating point value.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.threshold = 10.0 >

The threshold averaging period.  This is the time that the pedestal is
averaged over and is given in units of rise time.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.averaging = 20.0 >

The digitization pedestal.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.pedestal = 2048 >

The ADC maximum value.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.maximum = 4095 >

The ADC minimum value.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.minimum = 0 >

The pre-threshold time to save into a digit.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.preTrigger = 200 us >

The post signal time to save into a digit.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.postTrigger = 200 us >

This is the file of parameters to control the electronics simulation.

The integration window for the trigger.
< elecSim.simple.trigger.window = 500 ns > 

The trigger threshold in MeV.
< elecSim.simple.trigger.threshold = 5 MeV >

The time between triggers.  Part of this is dead time, part of it is the
integration.  
< elecSim.simple.trigger.integrationTime = 3 ms >

The offset between the trigger condition being met and the trigger.
< elecSim.simple.trigger.offset = 0 ns >

The probability that the electron will recombine with the argon ion.
< elecSim.simple.recombinationProb = 0.66 >

The activation (ionization) energy for argon
< elecSim.simple.activationEnergy = 23.6 eV >

The Liquid Argon drift velocity to use. 
< elecSim.simple.drift.velocity = 1.6 mm/mus >

The Liquid Argon diffusion coefficient to use.  This is from Shibamura et
al, "Ratio of Diffusion coefficient to electron mobility", PR A20, 1979
< elecSim.simple.drift.diffusion = 15 cm2/s >

The electron lifetime.
< elecSim.simple.drift.life = 2 ms >

The electronics noise.  This is the sqrt() of the noise per time bin.
According to talk at the Sante Fe collaboration meeting on 1 Feb 2013, the
noise rate is 600 electrons per 1 us, so sqrt(600) = 24.5.  The time bin is
not fixed, but assume 1 us per bin to get a conservative noise estimate.
< elecSim.simple.noiseSigma = 24.5 >

The amplifier shape peaking time.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.riseTime = 1000 ns >

The amplifier gain for the collection wires.  The gain must be matched to
the range of the ADC.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.gain.collection = 0.1 >

The amplifier gain for the induction wires.  The gain must be matched to
the range of the ADC.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.gain.induction = 0.3 >

The amplifier gain for the ganged PMTs.  The gain must be matched to
the range of the ADC.
< elecSim.simple.amplifier.gain.pmt = 0.0001 >

The digitization "frequency" (actually the time per bin).  This should be
about 1/4 of the shape peaking time.  The electronics specs have not been
set yet.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.step = 250 ns >

The digitization threshold.  A signal level over this triggers saving a
digit.   This is the difference between the signal and the pedestal.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.threshold = 20 >

The digitization pedestal.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.pedestal = 2000 >

The ADC full range.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.range = 4095 >

The pre-threshold time to save into a digit.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.preTrigger = 3000 ns >

The post signal time to save into a digit.
< elecSim.simple.digitization.postTrigger = 6000 ns >
